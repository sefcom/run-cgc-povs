* Challenge Information
** Not Working
*** NRFIN_00071
    + Makes use of `select` system call
    + According to the challenge author, "Vulnerability requires an awareness of timing, as the vulnerable code path will not be triggered unless a timeout occurs." (https://github.com/lungetech/cgc-challenge-corpus/tree/master/NRFIN_00071)
    + According to trailofbits porting-notes.txt, "SBTP wants to hash its .text. It assumes this goes from go() to longjmp()." (https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios/blob/master/disabled-challenges/SBTP/porting-notes.txt)
** Misc
*** CROMU_00088
    + Needs a high (120s) timeout
